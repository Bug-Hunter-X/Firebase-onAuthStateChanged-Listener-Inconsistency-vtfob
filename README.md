# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener fails to consistently trigger when the user's authentication status changes. This issue can arise due to network problems or internal Firebase errors, causing the application to rely on outdated or incorrect authentication data.

The `onAuthStateChangedBug.js` file contains code that replicates the problem. The solution, provided in `onAuthStateChangedSolution.js`, addresses the issue using error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure a reliable authentication check.
